Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize the damages over the transformer distribution. It has to be implicitly mentioned in the request, so that it does not contain “minimize damage over the transformer distribution”. The user specifies either the duration, the starting or the stopping times. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context. Add, randomly and not every time, context about for example brand car etc ...
