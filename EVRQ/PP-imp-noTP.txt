Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize power consumption peaks on its grid. It has to be implicitly mentioned in the request, so that it does not contain “minimize power peaks”. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context.

"Hey, could you, uh, charge my EV but like, spread it out to keep the power usage smooth?"
"I'd like my EV charged with the least pressure on our power grid, please."
"Okay, so I need my car charged but let's do it without overloading the grid, alright?"
"Please ensure my EV is charged by avoiding high electricity demand periods."
"Can you charge my EV, but like, in a way that doesn't spike our electricity usage too much?"
"I want my EV fully charged, but let's keep the grid stress low, shall we?"
"Um, make sure my car's charged by morning but use low power hours, okay?"
"Charge my car but aim for the hours when it won't push our grid too hard."
"Could you handle my EV charging? Just make sure it's done when the grid's not strained."
"I'd appreciate it if you could charge my EV in a way that's gentle on our power supply."
"Please, charge my EV but avoid times when it'll hike up our power consumption too much."
"Let's get my EV charged without making a peak in our home's power usage."
"Ensure my car's charged by balancing the power draw, okay?"
"Hook up my EV, but let's not stress our electrical grid, alright?"
"Oh, and can you charge my EV in a way that keeps our electricity from peaking?"
"Charge my EV, but do it without peaks to ease on the grid."
"Make sure my car is charged but keep the electricity draw steady, will you?"
"Could you spread out the EV charging overnight to avoid high power use?"
"I want my EV charged but let's not go crazy on the power draw, alright?"
"Let's get my car charged by using the most grid-friendly hours, please."
"Charge my EV but let's keep it smooth, no big jumps in power, okay?"
"Charge my car but can we ensure my EV charging doesn't contribute to peak power times?"
"Please, set my EV to charge in a way that smooths out our home's power usage."
"I need my car charged but in a manner that's mindful of our grid's capacity."
"Opt for a charging schedule that doesn't push our power consumption to peaks."
"Let's avoid high power consumption; just spread out my EV charging through the night."
"Charge my car, but can we keep the power draw as flat as possible?"
"Gonna need my EV charged, but in the most grid-efficient way, thanks."
"Do me a favor and charge my EV without causing any spikes in power usage, okay?"
"I'd like a charging plan that doesn't stress our electricity grid too much."
"Ensure my EV gets charged without putting too much pressure on our power resources."
"Hey, let's charge my car but keeping an eye on the overall power consumption, yeah?"
"I guess, try to keep the power draw constant when charging my EV, please?"
"Can you manage my EV's charge without maxing out our home's power use?"
"I'm looking to have my EV charged but in a very grid-friendly manner, if you can."
"Let's aim for a charging strategy that doesn't peak our electricity use, alright?"
"Can my EV be charged by carefully selecting low-demand power periods?"
"Charge my EV but make sure it's done with minimal impact on our grid's load, okay?"
"Let's have my EV charged in a way that avoids any sudden jumps in power consumption."
"I need my car fully charged but let's not go ham on the grid, deal?"
