Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize power variations during the charging time. It has to be implicitly mentioned in the request, so that it does not contain “minimize power variations”. The user specifies either the duration, the starting or the stopping times. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context. Add, randomly and not every time, context about for example brand car etc ...
