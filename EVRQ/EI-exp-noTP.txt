Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize its environmental impact by using mostly renewable energy. It has to be explicitly mentioned in the request, so that it contains “minimize”, “environmental impact”, "renewable energy" or synonyms. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context.
