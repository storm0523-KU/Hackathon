Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize the damage over the distribution transformer. It has to be explicitly mentioned in the request, so that it contains “minimize” and “transformer” or “distribution” or synonyms. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context. Be various, use car brand, etc ..? it's an order.

"Can you ensure the EV charging minimizes the load on the distribution transformer?"
"Hey, I'm charging my Tesla tonight. Can we minimize the strain on our transformer?"
"Let's minimize impact on the transformer when charging the car, okay?"
"I need the car charged but minimize the wear on our transformer, please."
"Could you set up the charger to minimize damage to the electrical transformer?"
