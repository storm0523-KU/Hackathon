Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize the power variations in order to preserve the charger. It has to be explicitly mentioned in the request, so that it contains “minimize” and “variations” or “chargers” or synonyms. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context. Be various, use car brand, etc ..? it's an order.
