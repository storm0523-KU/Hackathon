Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize the damage over the transformer distribution. It has to be explicitly mentioned in the request, so that it contains “minimize”, “transformer”,  "distribution" or synonyms. The user specifies either the duration, the starting or the stopping times. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context. Add, randomly and not all the time, context about brand car, etc ...
