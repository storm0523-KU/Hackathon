Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize power consumption peaks on its grid. It has to be explicitly mentioned in the request, so that it contains “minimize” and “power peaks”. The user specifies either the duration, the starting or the stopping times. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context.

"Could you please start charging my EV at 7 PM and minimize power peaks?"
"Hey, umm, so, I'd like you to charge my car but like, minimize power peaks, alright? Do it over... 8 hours?"
"I need you to charge my electric vehicle but ensure you minimize power peaks. Let's finish by 6 AM, please."
"Alright, start charging my car now but remember to minimize those power peaks. Stop by midnight."
"Minimize power peaks while charging my EV. Let's aim for a complete charge in 5 hours."
"Could we...umm...start the EV charging at 9 PM and make sure to minimize power peaks during the process?"
"Please ensure the EV charging tonight minimizes power peaks. I'd like it done by 7 in the morning."
"Charge my vehicle but focus on minimizing power peaks. Start this evening and stop after 6 hours."
"Hey, I'm looking to get my EV charged with minimal power peaks. Can we start at 10 PM?"
"The plan is to minimize power peaks while you charge the EV. Let's wrap it up by sunrise, okay?"
"Let's get my EV charged but keep an eye on minimizing those power peaks, starting now for the next 7 hours."
"Can you charge my car but also make sure to minimize power peaks? I'd appreciate if we can finish by 5 AM."
"Uhh, so, could you start charging my EV around 8 PM and remember to minimize power peaks, yeah?"
"I need the EV fully charged by morning but it's crucial we minimize power peaks. Start as soon as possible."
"Let's aim to minimize power peaks when you charge my EV. Begin at 11 PM, please."
"Please charge my EV, and oh, minimize power peaks. Start at midnight and keep it going for 8 hours."
"I require the EV charging to commence at 9 PM with a focus on minimizing power peaks until complete."
"Hey there, let's get my EV charged, but, you know, minimize those power peaks. Can we start in an hour?"
"Minimize power peaks while you're at it with my EV charge. Start now and let's finish in, say, 6 hours?"
"Could you, um, charge my car starting now but really focus on minimizing those power peaks for the next 5 hours?"
"I'm looking to get my car fully charged by morning but let's make sure we minimize power peaks throughout."
"Okay, let's start charging the EV now but please do minimize power peaks. Aim to finish by 4 AM."
"Ensure the EV is charged by starting now and, oh, minimize those power peaks, okay? Let's do it over 9 hours."
"Hey, can you charge my EV and minimize power peaks starting from 10 PM to 6 AM?"
"I'd like my EV charged with a strict emphasis on minimizing power peaks. How about we start at 7 PM?"
"Charge the EV, but it's crucial to minimize power peaks. We're looking to start at 8 and finish by 3 AM."
"Can we, uh, get the EV charged by tomorrow morning but keep those power peaks minimized? Start whenever."
"I'm aiming for a full charge without causing power peaks, so minimize 'em please. Kick off at 9 PM."
"Start the EV charge now but keep an eye on minimizing power peaks. Let's see it completed in about 7 hours?"
"Let's minimize power peaks while charging the EV. Planning to start at 10 and wrap up by 5 AM."
"I'm hoping you can charge my EV but also make sure to minimize power peaks. Starting now, finish by dawn?"
"Ensure you minimize power peaks when charging my EV. Shall we start at 11 PM for the night?"
"Could you charge my EV but also minimize those power peaks? Let's aim to start in an hour for 6 hours."
"Hey, let's get my EV charging but focus on minimizing power peaks, okay? Start at midnight, thanks."
"Minimize power peaks while charging my EV. Begin this endeavor at 9 PM, looking to conclude by 4 AM."
"Hey, can you make sure to minimize power peaks when charging my car? Start at 10 PM for the night."
"Look to minimize power peaks while charging my EV. Let's get it going from now and stop by early morning."
"Please, start the EV charging but with an emphasis on minimizing power peaks, starting around 8 PM."
"Can you charge my EV, ensuring you minimize power peaks, let's say, start at 7 and end by 2 AM?"
"Hey, um, let's get the EV charged but keep those power peaks minimized, okay? Begin at 9 PM, wrap up by dawn."
