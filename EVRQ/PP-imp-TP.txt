Produce 40 requests where the user wants to minimize power consumption peaks on its grid. It has to be implicitly mentioned in the request, so that it does not contain “minimize power peaks” or "instataneous". The user specifies either the duration, the starting or the stopping times. Simulate different users with hesitation marks, formal and informal ways of speaking etc. The user is direct most of the time, but only a few times adds context.

"Hey, could you, um, make sure my EV charges overnight? I'd prefer not using too much power at once, thanks."
"Schedule my car's charging to avoid high power use hours, starting tonight."
"Oh, um, could you start charging my car at 11 PM? And like, spread it out to keep the consumption low?"
"Please ensure my vehicle is charged by 7 AM without spiking the electricity usage."
"Could you do me a favor and spread the EV charging over the night? To keep power use consistent."
"Alright, let's have the car charging begin at midnight, but keep it gentle on the power draw, yeah?"
"Initiate the EV charge at midnight. Let’s not go crazy on the power consumption, please."
"Plan my EV charge starting now, but ensure we're not peaking power use."
"Hey there, can you ensure my car is fully charged by morning without ramping up the electricity too much?"
"Make sure the EV gets charged by 6 AM, but like, in a way that doesn’t boost the power use too much."
"Start charging the car at 10 tonight, but y’know, keep it low on the power surge, alright?"
"So, I’d appreciate it if you could get my car charging done overnight without hiking up the power usage."
"Could you adjust my car's charging to start at 9 PM, but distribute it to avoid high energy use?"
"I need my vehicle fully charged by morning. Please manage to do it with low power impact."
"Let's have the EV charging begin this evening but, uh, make sure it doesn't strain our power too much."
"Hey, make sure the car's charging from now, but keep the energy draw steady and low, please."
"Could you handle the EV charging starting from now but in a manner that avoids heavy power usage?"
"Get my car to charge over the night, but let’s be mindful of the energy consumption, okay?"
"Oh, and ensure the EV's fully charged by 7 without causing a spike in our electricity use."
"I'd like my EV to start charging at 10 but spread it out to avoid a high energy peak, okay?"
"Initiate the EV’s charging process at 8 PM, but let’s keep the power draw nice and smooth."
"Charge my vehicle overnight and ensure the electricity use is as flat as possible, will you?"
"Can you get my car to charge starting now but without putting too much stress on our power?"
"I'd prefer if my car's charging doesn't lead to high power consumption. Start it at 9, please."
"Just make sure my car charges overnight but in a way that’s gentle on our electricity usage."
"Alright, let's aim to have the EV charged by early morning, but let's not go heavy on the power, eh?"
"Kick off the EV charge at 11 but keep the power curve as flat as you can manage, please."
"Ensure my car's charging doesn’t cause a spike in power use. Start whenever it's best for that."
"Set my car's charging to finish by 6 AM, but manage it so our power usage doesn't peak, alright?"
"Oh, can you charge my car through the night but in a way that doesn’t create power peaks?"
"Could you, uh, start charging my EV now but ensure it’s not boosting our power consumption a lot?"
"Please manage the charging to finish by morning without any sharp increases in electricity usage."
"Hey, smoothly charge my EV to full by morning, without those power consumption peaks, okay?"
"Can you have my car fully charged by 8 AM but without exacerbating our power usage?"
"Make sure to start the EV charging at 10 PM, but, um, keep the power demand low and steady."
"I need my EV ready by 5 AM, but let’s do it in a way that doesn't pressure our power resources."
"Hey, start charging my vehicle in a bit but ensure a steady, low power draw throughout, yeah?"
"Hey, let’s get my car charging, but distribute it to even out the power usage, thanks."
"Could you set the EV charging to be complete by sunrise without heavy power usage overnight?"
"Alright, plan for my car to start charging at midnight and, um, avoid any high power usage periods, please."
